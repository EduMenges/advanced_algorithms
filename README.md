# Advanced Algorithms

This repository is for the Advanced Algorithms course, thaught by professor Marcus Ritt at UFRGS. It is divided upon 5 tasks, corresponding to directories listed here. All of them were implemented in C++.

## Task 1

Implements the Disjkstra algorithm using a min heap and tests it with varios lenghts of heaps.

## Task 2

Implements BFS, DFS and the fastest path algorithm and compares them when tracing a path between two vertices.

## Task 3

Implements the max flow algorithm to solve the tournament problem.

## Task 4

Implements the Hungarian algorithm that solves the assignment problem.

## Task 5

Solves the knapsack problem using DP and the algorithm proposeed by He & Xu (https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611977936.6), comparing the number of updates required.
